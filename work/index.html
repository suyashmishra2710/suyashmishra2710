<p><strong>Duration:</strong> August 2020 - August 2021, Spring 2023</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
<p>I was responsible for developing various geological lexicons that centralized geological records for a variety of countries, continents, and regions including China, Indian Plate, Thailand, Vietnam, Niger, Malaysia, Africa, Belgium, Middle East, Panama, Qatar, and South America. Each lexicon received its own website where it was able to search through its own database for geological records, search across all or some of the other region databases for geological records, parse geological records into databases, and create maps displaying geological formations at different time periods in the past. These websites are used by various geological experts around the world and continue to be developed for other countries.</p>
<p><strong>Key Achievements:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Integrated our lexicons with macrostrat api to integrate other geologists&rsquo; geological formation data with our past reconstruction system</li>
<li>Processed geospatial data to overlay geological formation locations on ancient world maps using PyGplates and PyGMT python libraries</li>
<li>Rebuilt Docker containers to incorporate necessary dependencies to facilitate on-demand recreations of the past at various time periods</li>
<li>Refined word document parsing system to automatically parse word documents into databases through regex commands, mySQL, and PHP</li>
<li>Upgraded user interface and backend API to improve geological formation searching in smaller time ranges via HTML and PHP</li>
<li>Updated mySQL queries in our API to enable searching of many countries&rsquo; geological records simultaneously</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Technologies Used:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Python: PyGplates, PyGMT</li>
<li>PHP</li>
<li>mySQL: Select &amp; Insert queries</li>
<li>Javascript</li>
<li>HTML &amp; CSS</li>

<p><strong>Duration:</strong> Summer 2020</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
<p>I was responsible for developing a variety of visualizations related to health data collected by Michigan Medicine patients&rsquo; Fitbits. These pieces of data were stored in various mySQL databases and tables that I queried from and cleaned before using JavaScript&rsquo;s Highcharts library to create interesting and user-friendly visualizations. These visualizations served as individually-tailored dashboards that Michigan Medicine patients accessed by entering a valid date range and their patient id.</p>
<p><strong>Key Achievements:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Collated and cleaned missing health data using missingno python library to enable more accurate analysis of data</li>
<li>Processed patient step data to visualize patient bouts of activeness (moments where patients were constantly taking steps for 10+ minutes)</li>
<li>Implemented visual tracking to monitor patient goal activeness in comparison to established objectives</li>
<li>Enhanced patient data privacy by implementing a secure data entry mechanism, allowing patients to input date range of activity along with their unique patient ID</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Technologies Used:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Python: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, missingno</li>
<li>mySQL: Select queries</li>
<li>Javascript: Highcharts</li>
<li>HTML &amp; CSS</li>
</ul>
